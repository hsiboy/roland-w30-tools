Here are the required steps:
- create a 80MB HD full of your samples (ie. 64 areas)
- connect the HD to your PC and with the help of some direct disk access
  program (like Norton Utilities), put the whole hard disk data into a
  file on one of your drives

- start the project1.exe program
- press the LoadHDImg button and select the file containing the HD data
- after a couple of seconds your areas will be listed under the sound
  directory
- on the CD-ROM there are groups, they can be used to group ;) areas
  together
- you MUST create at least one group and drag all your sounds onto it
  of course it is much more practical to create several groups and
  organize the sounds well
- you can add/change groups and change area names using the buttons
  below the lists
- when you are happy with the results, press the SaveCDImg button,
  select the destination file (if you have at least two HDD-s, select
  a different from the one containing the original HD data, this might
  save a couple of minutes)
- now you can exit from the program

- you need a CD-writer software which can read so called image files and
  able to create a CD from it
  use the previously created image file to feed the program

- voila, you have just finished your own W30-CD-ROM
