
This set of files contains the source code, VC++ 1.5 makefiles and executable of for the following 5 programs:

1) tonedump : extract and dumps some parameters of a given tone on a W30 disk
2) wdir : lists all the tone on a W30 disk
3) wget : extract a tone's wave from a W30 disk and convert it into .wav format. The compiled version will save 16bits sounds only. To save 8bits sounds, recompilation is needed and the keyword USE8BIT should be #defined.
4) winit : writes the information needed on a blank disk to make it usable for the W30. For more quick than the W30's format if you have pre-formatted disks
5) wput : convert a .wav soundfile into a W30 tone. Supports stereo file transfer.

Hope you'll enjoy them. There are already some troubles I'm already aware of. Leave me a mail if you have any suggestion/comments.
