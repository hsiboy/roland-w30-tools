This kind of sampler was developed by Roland people in 1991 and was a very profesional keyboard on the market, with 15kzh and 30kzh Rate of samples, 12 bit resolution, a very accurate algorithm for sample interpolation, and everything you want for managing sounds.

My tools are developed to make easy the translation around PC to Roland Sdisk's.

W30play.exe: Is a sound-stripper for image-disks, you can view all samples contents on disk-image with loop start, end and point info. With double click on the list, you can download the sample to your hard disk.

W30image.exe: Is a utility to manage image download-upload process, allow to read and write 720k disks

W30edit.exe: For edit some parameters on disk images, before downloading into 720k diskette.

The tools are written with Visual Basic 3 and VBRUN300.DLL is required!!!
