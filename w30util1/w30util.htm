<p>This kind of sampler was developed by Roland people in 1991
and was a very profesional keyboard on the market, with 15kzh and
30kzh Rate of samples, 12 bit resolution, a very accurate
algorithm for sample interpolation, and everything you want for
managing sounds.</p>

<p>My tools are developed to make easy the translation around PC
to Roland Sdisk's.</p>

<p><u>W30play.exe:</u> Is a sound-stripper for image-disks, you
can view all samples contents on disk-image with loop start, end
and point info. With double click on the list, you can download

process, allow to read and write 720k disks</p>
